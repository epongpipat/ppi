# this examples uses the following data from openneuro.org
# https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000171/versions/00001

# in this dataset, participants listen to either positive music,
# negative music, or tones (control). Positive and negative musical stimulus
# are presented for 31.5 seconds and tones are presented for 33 seoncds.
# After each stimulus, participants have 3 seconds to report their valence
# (from very sad to very happy) and arousal (from very passive to very #
# active). the repitition time (tr) for this dataset was 3 and the number of
# volumes collected for this was run 105.

# mri parameters

# 1. stimulus vs response
# 2. music vs tones
# 3. positive music vs negative music
